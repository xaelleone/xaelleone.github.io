<img align="left" style="padding-right: 10px" src="/assets/images/kmli_headshot_delmar.jpeg" width="100px"> Hi! I'm Kevin Matthew Li, a data scientist currently at the U.S. Census Bureau. I hold Master's and Bachelor's in city planning and computer science, respectively, both from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Previously, I worked in Democratic politics, spending time at the Texas Democratic Party, NGPVAN, and Progressive Turnout Project. 

I enjoy biking to new places, sitting on trains, playing go, and writing and solving puzzles. I'm from San Diego, CA and currently live in Chicago, IL.

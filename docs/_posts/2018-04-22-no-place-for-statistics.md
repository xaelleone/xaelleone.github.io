Unless you’ve actually checked the [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population), you probably have a very bad sense for what the largest cities in the United States are. For example, there are more people in San Antonio than in Washington, D.C. and Boston combined. There’s a city called Mesa in Arizona that is larger than Miami. Jacksonville, Florida is larger than Seattle, San Francisco, or Detroit.

Why do these facts so egregiously disagree with my intuition for city size? The “city”, in its technical definition in the United States, turns out to not really describe human settlement patterns at all. It’s an administrative boundary, one that defines who governs whom, which for a lot of us, doesn’t make much difference in our lives.

For my San Diego friends: do you know if La Jolla is a city? Poway? Carmel Valley? Me neither. They’re places, and places can be cities, neighborhoods of cities, towns, villages, hamlets, townships, colloquially named but not formally administered globs of unincorporated land, or any number of other things. The boundaries of the “city” are shaped by historical forces, annexation of surrounding governments, and arbitrary decisions by other governments that seldom reflect distinct identities and geographies. Miami is small because many people live in surrounding suburbs that are still kind of Miami, while Jacksonville decided to [eat its suburbs for lunch one day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Consolidation).

This isn’t just administrivia. Journalists, academics, and clickbait creators report things about “top cities” [all](https://fortune.com/2017/09/13/best-cities-to-find-a-job-2017/) [the](https://wallethub.com/edu/best-worst-cities-for-singles/9015) [time](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/27/tech-jobs-silicon-valley.html), and it isn’t totally clear what they mean. A city could be dense, suburban, filled with open space, have excellent schools, terrible crime rates, great restaurants or anything really depending on how the boundaries are drawn, and the boundaries don’t care about any of these things.

Aha, you say. That’s why we measure at the metropolitan area! The gold standard for this is the Metropolitan Statistical Area, developed by the U.S. Census Bureau, which encompasses the entire region around a city. Surely, this must be a more apt boundary for what defines the identity of a city.

According to this definition, larger than Seattle, Baltimore, St. Louis, or Denver is a town in California called Riverside, which, at 4.5 million people, is now somehow among the largest cities in the world. Unless you’re from Southern California, you’ve probably never heard of Riverside, and I’m not sure which of Riverside or Mesa is less relevant to your life.

What happened? It turns out that Metropolitan Statistical Area definitions are based on counties. The Census clumps together counties (or county equivalents, because some states don’t have them and some cities aren’t part of counties) based on volume of commuting between them. But counties aren’t shaped according to human settlement either: the Riverside metropolitan area includes Riverside County and San Bernardino County, totaling an area larger than West Virginia, that includes a massive, sparsely populated, West Virginia-sized swath of the Mojave Desert, the Coachella Valley, a wholly distinct cluster of cities which could either be the 70th or 200th largest metropolitan area in the United States depending on the season, Joshua Tree and Death Valley National Parks, parts of the Salton Sea, and the infinite suburbia of the rapidly-expanding more affordable eastern reaches of Greater Los Angeles. In short, it is a wholly unsuitable definition for the Inland Empire, which may be distinct from Los Angeles for its residents but maybe not for the rest of the country.

The inconvenient shapes of counties make for fairly ridiculous boundary definitions for the metropolitan area in the United States, especially in the West where counties are huge or inconveniently long or awkwardly include populated areas with lots of nothingness.

This is the problem with understanding what are the “largest cities” in a place, or ranking places at all. Counting is done according to boundaries that pay no attention to actual human settlement patterns, and we think they do. It’s certainly hardly the case that there aren’t meaningful statistics about places, but simply that these statistics might be systematically distorted by artifacts of irrelevant stories.
